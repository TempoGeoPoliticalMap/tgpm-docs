## Overview

We don't have any test automation yet, but the plans are and you are welcome to contribute to:

* To verify the min text coverage (unit tests)
* To add API Contract Testing
* To implement functional tests (to check that WikiData data is fetched and presented correctly)

The dev tasks can be found at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/TempoGeoPoliticalMap/projects/1); feel free to
create new tasks.

If you want to contribute, just raise a PR.
